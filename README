SIMPLE IRC BOT

Main use case is to provide %tell and %oka commands, but other
commands are welcome. The code also serves as a testbed to try
things out.

The bot creates a SQLite DB file to save information like the messages
to tell people later.

Connect information is set using command line flags.

Get the bot using:

    $ go get github.com/cmarcelo/ircbot
